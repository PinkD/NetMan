# NetMan

[English](README.md) | [简体中文](README-zh_CN.md)


NetMan is designed to prevent those apps from connecting to Internet:

- There are always some apps that waste your cellular data maliciously
- You just want to prevent an app from connecting to Internet anyway
- Allow app to connect Internet only when WIFI is connected
- ...

**Attention: This app is based on `iptables` , so `root` privilege is required!!**
